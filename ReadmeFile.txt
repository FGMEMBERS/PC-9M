Thanks to Johan G for amazing details on all liveries, Slovenian AF livery and testing. Without him we couldn't fix some bugs in package. Also I'd like to thank Rob Dosogne for Canadian livery and some fixes.

Big thanks to David Culp and Erik Hofman, this PC-9M package is based on their PC-7 package.

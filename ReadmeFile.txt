Thank you for downloading Pilatus PC-9 package, this is my first release for FlightGear.

The Pilatus PC-9 is a single-engine, low-wing tandem-seat turboprop training aircraft manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland. More info at www.pilatus-aircraft.com
There are more variations of PC-9: PC-7 Mk II, PC-9/A, PC-9M and T-6.

Big thanks to David Culp and Erik Hofman, this PC-9 package is based on their PC-7 model. I also want to thank xsaint for his tutorials and specially Johan G, SkyWlf77 and redneck for testing and helping me to fix some errors.
